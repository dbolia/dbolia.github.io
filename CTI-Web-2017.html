		        <h3>Introduction</h3>
		        <p class="catalog-text">The Department of Energy (DOE) has a dual responsibility to the public regarding classified data. The first part of this responsibility requires DOE to identify, classify, and subsequently protect certain information, defined by statutes and Executive orders that would cause damage to national security if released. The second part of this responsibility requires DOE to declassify information once it has been determined to no longer require protection. The duality of this mission requires DOE to constantly review its classified data and balance the requirements for protection against the requirements for dissemination. In this dynamic environment, DOE has established a comprehensive classification and declassification program based upon the consistent application of defined principles. To ensure that all classification and declassification decisions are based on these principles, the Office of Classification has undertaken the establishment and maintenance of a comprehensive classification and declassification education program.</p>

		        <p class="catalog-text">The training and education program is perpetually evolving with new courses and special briefings as events dictate. Basic courses that are in constant demand are described in this course catalog. Other more specialized courses and briefings have been developed and are available on an &#8220;as needed&#8221; basis</p>

					declassification.  A two-part final examination is given at the conclusion of the course. One part of the examination covers 
					declassification fundamentals and the other part consists of practical exercises. A score of at least 80 percent on each part is required 
					for passing. Handouts are provided along with copies of all slides used.  Handouts and slides provide ready reference material for the 
					student.</p>

					<p><span>Description: </span>This seminar is conducted jointly by DOE and the National Archives and Records Administration.  The purpose is to train all personnel who review records subject to the Special Historical Records Review Plan developed pursuant to the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense Authorization Act. Specifically, the seminar consists of an overview of the plan, a review of the requirements for processing records affected by the plan, and training on the recognition of RD and FRD in both marked and unmarked records.</p>
					<p><span>Delivery: </span>Completion of this seminar is delivered either in person or via an 85-minute video presentation 
					augmented with a Student Guide and a self-administered review exercise. The review exercise must be submitted to DOE for a student to 
					receive credit for completing the seminar.</p>
					<p><span>Course Goal: </span>Completion of this seminar will provide individuals with an understanding of agency 
					requirements under the Special Historical Records Review Plan and enable them to recognize collections that have the potential to contain RD and FRD in documents being reviewed under section 3.4 of Executive Order 13526 for the purpose of bringing them to the attention of an appropriate official.
